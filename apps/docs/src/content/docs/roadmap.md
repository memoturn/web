title: Roadmap
description: Current status of the prototype, the shipped surface, and the deferred work tracked in the architecture decision records.
---

Memoturn is at the **architecture + working prototype** stage. All planned prototype milestones
are built and tested: 67 cross-crate integration tests covering the memory layer, HTTP-level
hardening regressions, and true multi-node distribution against a real etcd (gated on
`ETCD_ENDPOINTS`). The stack is proven on Kubernetes — the Helm chart deploys to kind with MinIO
and auth, all HTTP benchmarks pass, and the chaos test holds: deleting the data-plane pod yields
a fresh pod with no PersistentVolume serving the same data with the same token in about
15 seconds. See [deployment](/deployment/).

Performance numbers on this page and in the repository are p50 prototype measurements (single
node, in-process object store), reproducible with `cargo run --release -p memoturn-bench`.

## Shipped surface

- **Typed agent memory** — `namespace > profile > memory`, where a profile is one database.
  Idempotent content-addressed ingest, supersession by topic key, hybrid recall (keyword + topic
  + vector, reciprocal-rank fused), sessions, forget. See [memories](/memories/) and
  [recall](/recall/).
- **Opt-in node services** — server-side [extraction](/extraction/) (`/extract`, 503 when
  unconfigured) and [auto-embedding](/embeddings/), both outside the write path.
- **Multi-model substrate** — documents on JSONB, KV with TTL, vectors, the transcript layer,
  and the SQL escape hatch, all in one database per profile. See [data model](/data-model/).
- **Branching** — O(1) copy-on-write forks, checkpoints, rewind, and auto-expiring burner
  branches. See [branching](/branching/).
- **Distribution** — object storage as the source of truth, single writer per database with
  lease + epoch fencing, write forwarding, replica reads with `txid`/`min_txid` — integration-
  tested multi-node against a real etcd. See [architecture](/architecture/) and
  [consistency](/consistency/).
- **Durability & GC** — opt-in Durable write mode (`MEMOTURN_DURABILITY=durable`, per-request
  `Memoturn-Durability` header) that acks only after segment ship + manifest CAS, and a
  refcounted object GC that is copy-on-write safe across branch manifests. See
  [consistency](/consistency/#durability-modes).
- **Access surfaces** — [REST API](/api-rest/), [CLI](/cli/),
  [TypeScript SDK](/sdk-typescript/), [Python SDK](/sdk-python/), and [MCP server](/mcp/).
- **Operations & hardening** — fail-closed auth (per-database and namespace JWTs, platform key,
  token revocation on database deletion), the SQL guard, request-surface limits, env-var node
  [configuration](/configuration/), and a hardened Helm chart (non-root read-only pods,
  NetworkPolicy, no K8s API token, etcd required for multi-replica). See [security](/security/)
  and [deployment](/deployment/).

## Deferred work

These items are tracked in the architecture decision records at
[github.com/memoturn/db](https://github.com/memoturn/db) (`docs/adr/`). No dates are attached;
the ordering below reflects dependency, not commitment.

### Storage and engine

- **Lazy page-fault VFS for databases over 16 MB.** The prototype restores whole databases on
  cold wake, which is the right trade for tiny per-profile databases; larger databases need
  page-granular faulting from object storage.
- **Point-in-time-recovery retention policy.** Branch, rewind, and refcounted GC of
  unreferenced objects exist; a retention/compaction policy for the immutable segment log does
  not yet.

### Branching and lifecycle

- **Three-way branch merge.** Out of scope for v1 by decision: agents fork-and-promote or
  fork-and-discard. Merge matters once branches host long-lived divergent work.
- **Whole-database TTL for ephemeral profiles on multi-node clusters.** Burner branches already
  expire; expiring an entire profile database needs cluster-wide sweep coordination.

### Distribution and operations

- **Cross-region replication** — bucket cross-region replication plus remote read replicas.
- **Per-tenant KMS encryption** of segments and manifests.
- **Kubernetes operator and CRDs**, replacing chart-level wiring for fleet operations. See
  [scaling](/scaling/) and [observability](/observability/).
- **gRPC transport for the node mesh.** HTTP suffices at prototype scale.
- **Billing pipeline** beyond the current usage counters.
- **Namespace as a first-class catalog column.** Profiles are databases named
  `{ns}--{profile}`; the convention upgrades to a catalog column with a one-time split.

### Assistant

- **The full built-in assistant** — natural-language query, schema and index advice, and an ops
  copilot. The design is shipped (`docs/architecture/06-mcp-and-assistant.md`); the CLI's `ask`
  command is a stub today and says so. Recall answer synthesis (turning recalled memories into a
  prose answer) lands here too, in the control plane rather than the data path.

## Sequencing

The data plane is deliberately small and the invariants are fixed: object storage as the source
of truth, single writer with epoch fencing, `txid` on every read. Deferred items either extend
the manifest layer (VFS, GC, merge, TTL), the control plane (operator, billing, catalog,
assistant), or the deployment story (cross-region, KMS) — none change the wire protocol in
[api-rest](/api-rest/). Items land when they are provable with the same end-to-end rigor as the
existing 67-test integration suite, not before.
